# Product List 

This is a React.js Base Project and I used styled-components for Design.

Below is some description of how I ran the project and how I worked on the project.

- First install React with this code "npm create vite@latest product-list -- --template react" from React Router.
- Then delete the codes of app.css and delete the by-default codes of index.css.
- Then some custom components are placed.
- Here are products filtered by category. And sorted into low to high and high to low and A to Z and Z to A categories.
- It is made responsive for all devices mobile tablet and desktop.
- Here four cards are placed on a page and the pagination system is don.
